## Florida Energy Redesign

This project aims to modernize the FESC website.

Two column charts were added to the homepage showing the renewable energy production and electricity total consumption between 1960-2016 in Florida.

Column charts was chosen due to the data labels are long so it may look cluttered with other types of charts.
